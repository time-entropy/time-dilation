### Time Dilation

Understanding on Lorentz-covariant rules in Special Relativity theory: The time perception of physical processes across distinct reference frames fundamentally corresponds to the observation of transformation counts. The observation time discrepancy between frames derives from the accumulated difference in their frame SEQ transformation counts. An observer measures another frame's time evolution through the differential transformation count ΔN, while he can’t perceive their own transformation count N0. The observed ΔN is fundamentally governed by the dynamic light-path difference between the observer's frame and the moving reference frame of the measured object. Under the principle of non-additivity of light speed (c-invariance), this formulation naturally derives Lorentz-covariant rules through counting operations.

##Key Distinction from GR Effects
While the mathematical derivation process aligns with standard special relativity textbooks—replacing continuous spacetime metrics with discrete counting operations—the physical interpretation differs substantially in conceptualization:

##SR Effects as Perceptual Phenomena
Time dilation and length contraction emerge purely as observer-dependent measurement consequences
Originate from information transmission constraints via discrete light-signal counting

##Contrast with GR Mechanisms
Gravitational time dilation involves actual deformation of the SEQ network's transformation frequency
Equivalence principle effects require space compression as well
